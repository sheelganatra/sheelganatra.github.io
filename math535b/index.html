<h3> Announcements </h3>


<ul>
    <li><b> 3/9/2020</b>: Our class will move to (remote) online instruction via Zoom for the remainder of the semester (as a campus-wide measure in response to the COVID-19 pandemic). Please let me know ASAP if you are not receiving Zoom class meeting invitations through Blackboard.
    </li>

    <li><b>2/14/2020</b>: There will be no class the week of 2/17-2/21; we will resume class on Monday 2/24.</li>

</ul>


</p>

<h3>Course Description and Prerequisites</h3>
<p> 
Math 535b is an advanced course on the geometry of (real and complex)
manifolds. The focus in Spring 2020 is on the geometry of manifolds equipped 
with extra structure, particularly of the following three varieties (with an
emphasis on the latter two): 
<ul>
    <li> Riemannian geometry (the study of manifolds with Riemannian structure, i.e., a metric induced by a family of inner products on tangent spaces).</li>
    <li> K&auml;hler geometry (the study of complex manifolds with a K&auml;hler metric, which is a special type of (Hermitian) metric whose purely imaginary part is closed). </li>
    <li> Symplectic geometry (the study of real even-dimensional manifolds with a symplectic form, which is a non-degenerate closed 2-form). </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
K&auml;hler manifolds are in particular complex manifolds which are Riemannian
and symplectic in a compatible way.  We will discuss examples of all three
types of manifolds and develop a basic toolkit for studying geometry in each of
these settings.  An emphasis of the course will be on understanding
<i>rigidity</i> properties of the latter two geometries: ways in which their
geometry and topology (as measured by e.g., their cohomology groups, or by
properties of certain maps or vector fields) are tightly constrained in
comparison to manifolds that do not possess these
structures.  </p>

<p> A more detailed lecture plan (updated on an ongoing basis, after each
lecture) will be posted below. </p>

<p>
In the last roughly two weeks of the course, the class will become student
run: students will give a series of talks about advanced topics in one or more
of these areas. A list of potential topics will be posted at a slightly later
date.
</p>

<!--<p>
Any K&auml;hler manifold is, after forgetting the complex structure both
Riemannian and symplectic. While a Riemannian structure always exists, the
conditions of being symplectic or further K&auml;hler are significantly more
rigid and, as we will see, cannot always exist. For a real manifold to be
K&auml;hler, there are both "local" obstructions (coming from whether a real
manifold can be made complex) and "global" obstructions (coming from the <i>
Hodge decomposition theorem</i>  which says that the de Rham cohomology of a
K&auml;hler manifolds has a very special form). For a real manifold to be
symplectic, there are no "local" obstructions (by the Darboux theorem, which
says that symplectic manifolds are all locally standard), there are significant
"global" obstructions (which, to begin, come again from cohomology).  
</p>

<p>
A central class of examples of K&auml;hler (hence also Riemannian and
symplectic) manifold comes from <i>smooth, projective complex varieties</i>
(subsets of complex projective space cut out smoothly by polynomial equations;
including projective space itself).  We will also see examples of manifolds
that are (real or complex but) not symplectic, and (symplectic) but not
K&auml;hler. Finally, we will discuss constructions in all of these categories.
</p>-->

<p>
We will assume basic familiarity with the geometry of manifolds, at the level
of USC's Math 535a course or equivalent.  
</p>


<h3>References</h3>

<p> Some planned topics to be surveyed include:  </p>

        neighborhoods, Poincare duality, and intersection theory for
        submanifolds.</li>

        from complex projective space and smooth projective complex varieties.
        The Kodaira embedding theorem.
    </li> 

</ul>


<p> There is no official course textbook, but we will frequently refer to the
following books (and likely others), primarily Lee and Cannas da Silva:

<ul>

    <li> Raoul Bott and Loring Tu, <i> Differential forms in Algebraic Topology </i> (Specifically Chapter 1, which gives a nice treatment of De Rham cohomology, Poincar&eacute; duality using differential forms, the K&uuml;nneth theorem, vector bundles, ...).</li>

    <li> John Lee, <i> Riemannian manifolds: An Introduction to Curvature </i>.</li>

    <li> Ana Cannas da Silva, <i>Lectures on symplectic geometry</i>, available <a href="https://people.math.ethz.ch/~acannas/Papers/lsg.pdf">online</a>. </li>

    <li> Raymond Wells, <i>Differential analysis on complex manifolds.</i>  </li>

    <li> Claire Voisin, <i> Hodge Theory and Algebraic Geometry, I. </i> </li>

</ul>

<p>We will also make key use of the following course notes:
<ul>
    <li> Professor Ko Honda's Differential geometry course notes: <a href="http://www.math.ucla.edu/~honda/math225a/revised%20course%20notes.pdf">first semester</a> and <a href="http://www.math.ucla.edu/~honda/math535b/notes.pdf">second semester</a>. </li>
    <li> Professor Denis Auroux's 2007 MIT course, 
        <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-966-geometry-of-manifolds-spring-2007/lecture-notes/">18.966: Geometry of Manifolds</a></li>
    <li> Professor Ralph Cohen's lecture notes, <a href="http://math.stanford.edu/~ralph/fiber.pdf">The topology of
        fiber bundles</a> (we will  use this as a supplementary reference at times when we might discuss vector and or principal bundles).</li>

</ul>
</p>

<p> For review of the introductory geometry and topology of manifolds, you may
wish to consult the textbook used frequently in Math 535a, <i> Foundations of
    Differential Manifolds and Lie Groups </i> by Frank Warner.  An alternative
introductory textbook is <i>Introduction to Smooth Manifolds</i> by John Lee. A
nice complementary reference is Guillemin and Pollack's <i>Differential
    Topology</i>, particularly its chapter on intersection theory.</p>

<h3>Grading System</h3>
<p>
Your grade in the course, a measure of your demonstrated understanding of
course topics, will come from participation along with two (individual) final
assignments: 
    <ul>
        <li> A lecture given in the final weeks of the course, on an advanced topic building on what is covered in the class. 
         and  </li>
        <li> A final expository paper, at least 5 pages long, about an advanced
        topic as above. This is allowed, but does not need to exactly coincide
        with your lecture topic. In fact, even if the topic is the same, the
        paper should necessarily have more details and/or differing emphasis
        from what is lectured about in class.
        </li> </ul>
    <p>A list of possible topics for the above assignments will be provided
    later in the semester. You are also welcome to propose a different topic,
    subject to instructor approval.</p>
    </a>


<h3>Homework Assignments</h3>
<p>
Some optional (ungraded) homeworks exercises may be assigned periodically
throughout the semester. They will be posted here on an ongoing basis.

Linear symplectomorphisms. Any symplectic vector space has a standard basis and hence is linear symplectomorphic to R2n with its standard symplectic structure. Then, symplectic manifolds: first definition and examples: R2n, cotangent bundles, orientable 2-manifolds, products. Symplectomorphisms.

        The Hamiltonian vector field associated to a Hamiltonian H is tangent
        to the level sets of H (i.e., the flow preserves H, unlike the
        <i>gradient vector field</i> of a function f with respect to a metric,

        familiar conservation of energy)

            Complex structures J on a vector space which are <i>compatible</i>
            with a given symplectic structure Omega (and hence induce a metric
            g_J = Omega(-,J-)).  Compatible complex structures exist: moreoever
            given a fixed Omega and any inner product g, there is a canonical
            almost Omega-compatible almost complex structure J one can build.
            (g is not necessarily equal to the resulting inner product g_J =
            Omega(-,J-)); instead one realizes g always equals Omega(-,A-) for
            some A which need not be a complex structure, and then apply
            <i>polar decomposition</i> to A to produce the desired J.
            <i>Compatible triples</i> are triples of the form (Omega, J, g_J)
            where J is compatible with Omega and g_J = Omega(-,J-) is the
            resulting inner product. Any two of Omega, J, g in a compatible
            triple determine the third.

        Examples of isotropic and coisotropic submanifolds. More about compatible triples. Almost complex structures on manifolds, and compatible (with a symplectic form) almost complex structures. Compatible (with a given omega) almost complex structures always exist and the space of such compatible structures is compatible. The space of symplectic structures compatible with a given almost complex structure is convex (hence contractible), although could be empty.

       Complex structures and complexification: given a real vector space V with complex structure J: V to V, the resulting complex vector space (V,J) is complex-linearly isomorphic to the (+i) eigenspace V^(1,0) of J on the <i>complexification</i> V_C of V (namely V_C = V tensor_R C). We call this (+i) eigenspace the <i>(1,0)</i> part, or the holomorphic (with respect to J) part, of the complexification V_C. V_C splits into (1,0) part plus its complex conjugate V^(0,1), (0,1) part or equivalently the (-i) eigenspace for J. The manifold version: the complexified tangent bundle, and its corresponding holomorphic and anti-holomorphic parts (with respect to an almost complex structure).
