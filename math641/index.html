<h3>Course Description and Prerequisites</h3>
<p> 
In Spring 2021, Math 641 will be an advanced <i> algebraic topology</i> course, roughly a continuation of Math 540.
</p>
<p> 
The goals of this class will be to introduce and study: the cohomology ring of a topological space and its basic properties (universal coefficient theorem, Kunneth theorem, etc.), Poincare duality, <i>vector bundles</i>, and their <i> characteristic classes</i>. Vector bundles arise frequently in geometry and topology, particularly in the study of manifolds (as developed in Math 535a) through tangent bundles of manifolds and normal bundles to embeddings. Characteristic classes are certain cohomology classes associated to the base of a vector bundle measuring the non-triviality of the bundle. </p>

<p>Along the way, we will study properties of more general fibrations (and more specifically principal bundles) and classifying spaces. Time permitting, we will introduce <i> spectral sequences</i>, <i> homotopy groups</i>, and give applications of theory of characteristic classes to the study of <i> cobordism</i> and the classification theory of manifolds.
</i>



<p>
We will require familiarity with the geometry of manifolds and algebraic topology at the level
of USC's Math 535a and Math 540 courses or equivalent.
Familiarity with homologial algebra at the level of the Math 510 series may also help at
various points in the class.  </p>


<p> A more detailed lecture plan (updated on an ongoing basis, after each
lecture) will be posted below. </p>

<p>
</p>

<p> There is no official course textbook, but we will frequently refer to the
following books and notes (and likely others). All of them are available online (either freely via the link provided or through USC libraries subscriptions).

wish to consult the textbook used frequently in Math 535a, <i> Foundations of
    Differential Manifolds and Lie Groups </i> by Frank Warner.  An alternative
introductory textbook is <i>Introduction to Smooth Manifolds</i> by John Lee. A
nice complementary reference is Guillemin and Pollack's <i>Differential
Topology</i>, particularly its chapter on intersection theory.</p>-->

<h3>Grading System</h3>
<p>
We will assign homework exercises, to be collected once every 1-2 weeks. Almost all of these exercises are optional, and your submission will in fact only be graded on one problem per submission (of your choosing), and then also only for completeness. Your overall HW score will account for half of your grade</p>

<p> At the end of the course, there will be a final paper assignment, accounting for the other half of your grade. </p>

<h3> Student final papers</h3>
<p> As part of this course, you will write a 5-10 page expository paper on a topic of your choosing (with instructor approval), which develops some of the topics touched in our class. Some general options for expository paper topics include: </p>


<ul>

    <li> Milnor and/or Segal's construction of, and properties of BG. </li> 
    <li> Cohomology calculations via spectral sequences of a series of manifolds (e.g., classical groups) </li>

    <li> Eilenberg-Maclane spaces and/or their cohomology groups </li>
    <li> The Gysin sequence and applications </li>
    <li> K-theory and some applications (Bott periodicity, the study of division algebras, etc.) </li>
    <li> Model categories and some applications (too large of a topic, would need to specify a sub-topic) </li>
    <li> The Brown representability theorem, and/or spectra</li>
    <li> The Chern character and/or other multiplcative characteristic classes, and applications </li>

</ul>


<p> Final papers will be due (by e-mail to the instructor) on <b>May 12</b>.</p>
