<h3>Course Description and Prerequisites</h3>
<p> 
In Spring 2021, Math 641 will be an advanced <i> algebraic topology</i> course, roughly a continuation of Math 540.
</p>
<p> 
The goals of this class will be to introduce and study: the cohomology ring of a topological space and its basic properties (universal coefficient theorem, Kunneth theorem, etc.), Poincare duality, <i>vector bundles</i>, and their <i> characteristic classes</i>. Vector bundles arise frequently in geometry and topology, particularly in the study of manifolds (as developed in Math 535a) through tangent bundles of manifolds and normal bundles to embeddings. Characteristic classes are certain cohomology classes associated to the base of a vector bundle measuring the non-triviality of the bundle. </p>

<p>Along the way, we will study properties of more general fibrations (and more specifically principal bundles) and classifying spaces. Time permitting, we will try to say something about <i> spectral sequences</i>, <i> homotopy groups</i>, and/or applications of theory of characteristic classes to the study of <i> cobordism</i> and the classification theory of manifolds.
</i>


<!--The main goal of this class is to develop the theory of <i> vector bundles</i>, which are roughly speaking families of vector spaces over some base, and <i> characteristic classes</i>, which are cohomological invariants that measure the failure of such a family to be trivial (i.e., a product). Vector bundles arise frequently in geometry and topology, particularly in the study of manifolds (as developed in Math 535a) through tangent bundles of manifolds and normal bundles to embeddings. Along the way, we will review properties of <i> cohomology</i>, <i>fibrations</i> (and principal bundles), -->


<p>
We will require familiarity with the geometry of manifolds and algebraic topology at the level
of USC's Math 535a and Math 540 courses or equivalent.
Familiarity with homologial algebra at the level of the Math 510 series may also help at
various points in the class.  </p>


<p> A more detailed lecture plan (updated on an ongoing basis, after each
lecture) will be posted below. </p>


<!--<p>
In the last roughly one or two weeks of the course, the class will become student
run: students will give a series of talks about advanced topics in one or more
of these areas. There will be a wide array of topics possible, ranging from
geometric to algebraic to combinatorial.
</p>-->

<!--<p>
Any K&auml;hler manifold is, after forgetting the complex structure both
Riemannian and symplectic. While a Riemannian structure always exists, the
conditions of being symplectic or further K&auml;hler are significantly more
rigid and, as we will see, cannot always exist. For a real manifold to be
K&auml;hler, there are both "local" obstructions (coming from whether a real
manifold can be made complex) and "global" obstructions (coming from the <i>
Hodge decomposition theorem</i>  which says that the de Rham cohomology of a
K&auml;hler manifolds has a very special form). For a real manifold to be
symplectic, there are no "local" obstructions (by the Darboux theorem, which
says that symplectic manifolds are all locally standard), there are significant
"global" obstructions (which, to begin, come again from cohomology).  
</p>

<p>
A central class of examples of K&auml;hler (hence also Riemannian and
symplectic) manifold comes from <i>smooth, projective complex varieties</i>
(subsets of complex projective space cut out smoothly by polynomial equations;
including projective space itself).  We will also see examples of manifolds
that are (real or complex but) not symplectic, and (symplectic) but not
K&auml;hler. Finally, we will discuss constructions in all of these categories.

<h3>References</h3>


<p> There is no official course textbook, but we will frequently refer to the
following books and papers (and likely others):

<ul>

    <li> Allen Hatcher's books:  <i> Algebraic Topology </i> [H-AT], <i> Vector bundles and K-theory</i> [H-VB] , and <i>Spectral sequences in algebraic topology</i> [H-SS]  (all available free online). </li>

    <li> Glen Bredon's <i> Topology and Geometry </i> (Springer GTM, available online through SpringerLink/USC Libraries)</li>

    <li>Milnor and Stasheff's <i> Characteristic classes</i>, Annals of Mathematics Studies. Available online through USC libraries.</li>

    <li> Stong's <i> Notes on cobordism theory</i> </li>.

    <li> Bott and Tu's <i> Differential forms in algebraic topology</i>.


</ul>


</p>

<!--<p> For review of the introductory geometry and topology of manifolds, you may
wish to consult the textbook used frequently in Math 535a, <i> Foundations of
    Differential Manifolds and Lie Groups </i> by Frank Warner.  An alternative
introductory textbook is <i>Introduction to Smooth Manifolds</i> by John Lee. A
nice complementary reference is Guillemin and Pollack's <i>Differential
Topology</i>, particularly its chapter on intersection theory.</p>-->

<h3>Grading System</h3>
<p>
We will assign homework exercises, to be collected once every 1-2 weeks. Almost all of these exercises are optional, and your submission will in fact only be graded on one problem per submission (of your choosing), and then also only for completeness. Your overall HW score will account for half of your grade</p>

<p> At the end of the course, there will be a final paper assignment, accounting for the other half of your grade. </p>

<!--<h3>Homework Assignments</h3>
<p>
Some optional (ungraded) homeworks exercises may be assigned periodically
throughout the semester. They will be posted here on an ongoing basis.  
</p>
