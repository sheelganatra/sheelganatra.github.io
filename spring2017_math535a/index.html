<h3>Course Description and Prerequisites</h3>
<p> 
Math 535a gives an introduction to geometry
and topology of <i>smooth (or differentiable) manifolds</i> and notions of
calculus on them, for instance the theory of <i>differential forms</i>. We will
assume familiarity with undergraduate topology, at the level of USC's Math 440
or equivalent. Exposure to theoretical linear algebra will also help (but will
be quickly reviewed).
</p>

</ul>-->

<h3>Textbook and topics</h3>
<p> The official course text is <i> Foundations of
    Differential Manifolds and Lie Groups </i> by Frank Warner. We will
frequently deviate from this book; additional references will be posted on an
ongoing basis.</p>

<p> Some topics to be covered include:  </p>

<ul>
    <li> A review of Calculus on R^n: inverse and implicit function theorems </li>
    <li> Topological and Differentiable manifolds and maps between them. Sard's theorem.</li>
    <li> The tangent bundle: vector fields, distributions, and Frobenius' theorem </li>
    <li> Calculus on manifolds with differential forms, tensors, and vector fields.</li>
    <li> Integration. Stokes' theorem and de Rham cohomology.</li>
    <li> (time permitting) An introduction to <i>Riemannian geometry</i>: Riemannian metrics, connections, and curvature</li>
</ul>

<p> A more detailed lecture plan (updated on an ongoing basis, after each lecture) will be posted below. </p>

<h3>Grading System</h3>
<ul>
    <li> 65% Homework assignments, </li>
    <li> 5% Note taking, </li>
    <li> 30% Take-home final exam. </li>
</ul>



<h3>Homework Assignments</h3>
<p>Homeworks will be posted here on an ongoing basis (roughly a week or more before they are due) and will be due on the date listed. You can handwrite or <i>LaTeX</i> your solutions. You may work with others and consult references (including the course
textbook), but the homework you turn in must be
written by you independently, in your own
language, and you must cite your sources and
collaborators.
<p>

<p> <i>Note</i>: Homework deadline extensions are possible upon arrangement with me (with our TA, Viktor CC'ed) up to 3 times a semester, and at most once per HW. If you decide to request an extension from me, there will be no grading penalty if the HW is submitted within a couple days -- I'll set a more precise deadline each request. <i>Beyond this, late homework will not be accepted.</i></p>

<h3>Note taking</h3>
<p>I will ask each of you to be the official note taker for 4-5
lectures, and produce a set of typed (and revised) notes for the
lecture. These should be completed and e-mailed to me within one week of the
lecture, or one week of the day you were assigned the lecture, whichever is
greater (so, if you were assigned on January 10 to write lecture notes for the
January 9 class, you would have until January 17).  You are required to use
<i>LaTeX</i> to typeset these notes; now is a good time to learn LaTeX if you
have not already. As a LaTeX template, please use the January 9th lecture
notes, whose TeX (and PDF) are provided below.
</p>

<p> <i>Note</i>: Some limited extensions are generally possible for note-taking
assignments. Please e-mail me to arrange. </p>





<h3> Takehome Final Exam </h3>

<p>
The takehome final will be a one-week exam, assigned via e-mail.  You are
strongly encouraged, but not required, to type up your solutions to the exam in
LaTeX. When solving the problems, you can use any results we have used, stated,
or proved in class or on your homeworks. If you wish you may consult other
references (such as the textbook, coursenotes, homeworks, other references) for
definitions, but you must solve these problems completely on your own. You may
not discuss your solutions with other people except for the course staff (Sheel
and Viktor).
