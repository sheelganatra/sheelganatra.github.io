<h3>Course Description and Prerequisites</h3>
<p>Math 113, a linear algebra course, will initiate the study of <i> vector
    spaces </i> and <i> linear maps </i> between vector spaces. The first and
most familiar example of a vector space is the set of n-tuples of real or
complex numbers. However, we shall see that vector spaces and the techniques of
linear algebra can be found on many sets with good notions of addition and
multiplication by scalars (for example: polynomials with real or complex
coefficients).  This class will focus more on abstract properties as well as
their geometric interpretations, and less on computational aspects. In
addition, we will emphasize learning to write clear and compelling proofs. 
</p>

<p> 
Math 113 is appropriate for students who have already seen some linear
algebra (e.g., Math 51), but linear algebra is not a strict prerequisite. </p>

<p> Depending on your interests, you may prefer Math 104, which emphasizes
applications of linear algebra over the abstract theory. </p>

<!--will initiate the study of 
algebraic invariants of topological 
spaces up to <i> homotopy equivalence </i>. Through this quarter we will
construct, prove properties about, and study applications of three such
invariants:</p>
<ol>
    <li> <b>Fundamental Group</b>. Covering spaces, the fundamental group of the circle, Van Kampen's theorem, the relation between covering spaces and the fundamental group.</li>
    <li> <b>Homology</b>. Simplicial, singular, and cellular homology. Equivalence of definitions. Excision and the Mayer-Vietoris sequence. Classical applications (Jordan curve separation, Borsuk-Ulam, Brouwer-fixed point, etc.).  </li>
    <li> <b>Cohomology</b>. Cup product. The Universal Coefficient Theorem, and
    the Kunneth formula. Poincar&eacute; duality. </li> 
</ol>
<p>As a necessary ingredient, we will develop techniques in <i>homological algebra</i>. A
basic class of topological spaces we will apply our discussion to is the class of <i> CW
    complexes</i>. -->


<!--<h3>Prerequisites</h3>-->

<p>
<!--In addition to formal prerequisites, we will use a number of notions and
concepts without much explanation. <i>Topologically</i>: you should be intimately
familiar with point-set topology, in particular various constructions on
spaces, the product and quotient topologies, continuity, compactness.
<i>Algebraically</i>: groups, rings, homomorphisms, equivalence relations,
quotient sets, quotients of groups by normal subgroups.-->
</p>

<h3>Textbook and supplementary notes</h3>
<p> Our course will primarily use Sheldon Axler's <i>
    Linear Algebra Done Right</i>. </p>
<p> For further reference, you may also check Professor Katznelson's lecture
notes, available <a href="katznelson-linalgebra.pdf">here</a>.
</p>

<p> Here are some important supplementary notes: 
<ul>
    <li> The <a href="notes/tensor_products.pdf">tensor product</a> of two
    vector spaces (after HW 7) </li>
    <li> <a href="notes/wedge_products.pdf">Wedge products and determinants</a>
    (after tensor products), including basis-independent definitions of the
    determinant and characteristic polynomial </li>
    <li> Understanding the <a href="notes/cross_products.pdf">cross product</a> 
    in R^3 in terms of the language of wedge products (Note: this will not be
    on the final at all, and is strictly for those who are interested). </li>
</ul>
</p>


<h3>Course Grade</h3>
<p>The course grade will be based on the following: </p>
<ul>
    <li> 30% Homework assignments, </li>
    <li> 30% Midterm exam, </li>
    <li> 40% Final exam </li>
</ul>



<h3>Homework Assignments</h3>
<p>Homeworks will be posted here on an ongoing basis (roughly a week before
they are due) and will be due at 4pm on the date listed, at our Course
Assistant, Graham White's office (380-R). Please submit your homework either
directly to Graham if he is in his office, or slide the homework under his door
if he is away. <i>Late
    homeworks will not be accepted.</i> In order to accomodate
exceptional situations such as serious illness, your lowest homework score will
be dropped at the end of the quarter.
You are encouraged to discuss problems with each other, but you must work on
your own when you write down solutions. The <a
href="http://www.stanford.edu/dept/vpsa/judicialaffairs/guiding/honorcode.htm">Honor
Code</a> applies to this and all other written aspects of the course. </p>

<p> Homework problems will often consist of proofs. Even if a problem doesn't
start with "Prove that..." you are expected to prove your argument is correct.
Please make sure to write complete sentences, not just a string of formulas,
and emphasize which axioms, propositions, lemmas, and theorems you use in your
argument. </p>

</p>

<p> The topics for the midterm were the first four and a half weeks of
class: topics will range from first definitions of vector spaces to linear
maps, eigenvalues, eigenvectors. (Chapters 1-5 of the book, not including
Chapter 4, aside from the statement of the fundamental theorem of algebra). It
was a <i> closed book, closed note </i> exam.  </p>

<p> <a href="old_exams/midterm2010.pdf">Here</a> is an exam from 2010 that you
may have used for practice. <a href="old_exams/midterm2011.pdf">Here</a> is a
slightly newer one, along with a set of <a href="old_exams/midterm2011_solutions.pdf">solutions</a>. Bear in mind that
the topics cover differ somewhat year to year, so the questions will not be
exactly representative of the material you have or have not learned to date.
</p>


<p> The final exam was be held on June 11th (Tuesday) from 3.30-6.30pm, in
room 380-380Y. <a href="final.pdf">Here</a> is a copy of the final. <a
    href="final_solutions.pdf">Here</a> are solutions.</p>

<p>The topics for the final were the content of the entire class, with an emphasis
on material after the midterm (Chapters 8-9, and 6-7 from Axler, along with
class notes on tensor products and wedge products). <a href="old_exams/final2010.pdf">Here</a> is one practice final from 2010,
and <a href="old_exams/final2011.pdf">here</a> is another one from 2011.
<!--topics from the first midterm, Chapters 6-9, notes and
homework about tensor products and bilinear maps, and determinants following the
notes and class lecture (you are welcome to refer to Chapter 10 as well, though
it does not contain an exposition on wedge products). --> </p>
<!-- <p> The final exam will be held in a room TBD on Tuesday, June 11th, from
3.30-6.30 pm </p> -->
