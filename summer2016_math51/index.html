</ul>

<p> <b>July 24, 2016</b>: Here are some important dates to keep in mind this week:
<ul>
    <li> There will be <i> no class</i> on Monday, July 25. </li>
    <li> Zev will lead a <i>review session</i> on Tuesday, July 26 in lieu of usual class, and <i>through both classes</i>. Students are welcome to come to both sections review sessions, as the material covered will in general be different.</li>
    <li> Your second midterm exam will be on <i>Wednesday, July 27</i> in class. See below for more details about topics covered on the exam.</li>
</ul>
</p>-->

<h3>Course Description and Prerequisites</h3>
<p> 
Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calculus are two of the most widely used mathematical tools across all scientific disciplines. This course seeks to develop background in both and highlight the ways in which multivariable calculus can be naturally understood in terms of linear algebra.</p>

<p> By the end of this course, you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
    <li> Understand notions in linear algera, such as vectors and their spans, matrices and their relationship to linear transformations, subspaces and their bases.</li>
    <li> Solve and analyze systems of linear equations, and relate the solution set to properties of algebraic objects (matrix null space, column space) associated to the system.
    <li> Analyze the rate of change of a multivariable function in coordinate directions via partial derivatives. Aggregate partial derivatives (derivative matrix, gradients) to get local information such as: tangent planes, linear approximation, and directional derivatives.</li>
    <li> Use differential calculus techniques such as critical points and Lagrange multipliers to solve for constrained local and global extrema.</li>
    <!--@@TODO:For a detailed syllabus see the Syllabus page.-->
</ul>

<p><b>Prerequesites</b> (from the Stanford Course catalogue): Math 21, or 42, or a
score of 4 on the BC Advanced Placement exam or 5 on the AB Advanced Placement
exam, or consent of instructor. <i> Note that our prerequesite for the above AP
exam scores is not strict, so if you believe you have comparable requesite
background, you are welcome to enroll.</i></p>


<h3>Textbook and Learning Resources (Office Hours, Tutoring)</h3>
<p> The textbook is a special combined edition of Levandosky's <i>Linear Algebra</i> book and parts of Colley's <i>Vector Calculus</i>. (We will use Chapter 2 and 4 from the 4th edition of Colley.) Hard-copy versions of the text should be available at the campus bookstore. An electronic version is also available. If you are interested in one, read these <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/math51/math51_electronic_student.pdf">instructions</a> and then go to the publisher's <a href="http://www.pearsoncustom.com/ca/stanford_math51/">site</a>.</i></p>

<p> Calculators are neither required nor recommended for Math 51 (and will not be allowed on exams anyway). </p>

<p> Each member of the course staff will hold <i>office hours</i> every week in which
you can discuss concepts covered in classes, homework problems, or other
class-related questions. You may attend the office hours of <b>any</b> member
of the course staff, and no appointment is ever necessary.</p>

<p><a href="https://sarc.stanford.edu/tutoring">Stanford Summer Tutor Program (STP)</a> offers FREE tutoring and academic skills
coaching to students enrolled in Stanford's Summer Quarter; just drop in. Math tutoring is held in the Organic Chemistry Building, and the weekly schedule is posted <a href="https://sarc.stanford.edu/tutoring/schedule">here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="hints.html">Here</a> is some advice for succeeding in Math 51, given by Professor Brumfiel (slightly modified to account for the different structure of the class in summer).

<p><b>Statement from the Registrar concerning students with documented disabilities:</b> 
<br>
"Students who may need an academic accommodation based on the impact of a disability must initiate the request with the Office of Accessible Education (OAE). Professional staff will evaluate the request with required documentation, recommend reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Accommodation Letter for faculty dated in the current quarter in which the request is being made. Students should contact the OAE as soon as possible since timely notice is needed to coordinate accommodations. The OAE is located at 563 Salvatierra Walk (phone: 723-1066)."
</p>

<h3>Course Grade</h3>
<p>The course grade will be based on the following: </p>
<ul>
    <li> 17.5% Homework assignments (assigned and due weekly), </li>
    <li> 23.5% Midterm Exam 1 (on <b>Wednesday, July 6</b> in class), </li>
    <li> 23.5% Midterm Exam 2 (on <b>Wednesday, July 27</b> in class), </li>
    <li> 35.5% Final Exam (on <b>Saturday, August 13</b> from 7:00pm-10:00pm, <i>same time for both sections</i>).</li>
</ul>



<h3>Homework Assignments</h3>
<p>Homeworks will be posted here on an ongoing basis. Please read carefully the <a href="hw_policy.html">Weekly Homework Policy</a> before submitting your homework assignment; it gives important instructions in how to approach the homework assignments and how to write up (for instance, you are required to <i>show all your work</i> for full credit; just answers given will often receive no credit). </p>

<p> <b>HW Submission Instructions</b>: 
<ul>
    <li> <b> Section 01 (1:30pm-2:50pm) students</b>: Submit your assignments to <b>Zev Rosengarten</b>, either (a) in person at his office, (b) under his office door, or (c) via e-mail (<i>no photos please! only typed or scanned solution sets</i>).</li>

    <li> <b> Section 02 (3:00pm-4:20pm) students</b>: Submit your assignments to <b>Valentin Buciumas</b>, either (a) in person at his office, (b) under his office door, or (c) via e-mail (<i>no photos please! only typed or scanned solution sets</i>).</li>
</ul>
</p> 
<!--(roughly a week before
they are due) and will be due at 4pm on the date listed. 
Please submit your homework either directly to our Course Assistant Alex if
he is in his office (380-380M) or slide the homework under his door if he
is away. --></p>


<p> <i>Late homeworks will not be accepted.</i> 
In order to accomodate exceptional situations such as serious illness, your lowest homework score will be dropped at the end of the quarter.  
You are encouraged to discuss problems with each other, but you must work on your own when you write down solutions. 
The <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/dept/vpsa/judicialaffairs/guiding/honorcode.htm">Honor Code</a> applies to this and all other aspects of the course. </p>

<p>
As homeworks are completed, solutions (in PDF) will be uploaded here.  </p>

<p> Once you pick up your graded HWs, it is your responsibility to look over your assignment (and CourseWork grade), along with the posted solutions, to make sure it is correctly graded. <a href="regrade_policy.html">Here</a> are instructions for how to submit a <a href="regrade_policy.html">regrade request</a> in case there is any issue with your grade.</p>

<h3> Midterm and Final Examinations </h3>

<p>All exams for Math 51 are <i>closed-book</i>, <i>closed-notes</i> exams, with no
calculators or other electronic aids permitted. Furthermore, they are all
<i>cumulative</i> (so Midterm 2 will test on everything covered in class to
that point, not just everything covered since Midterm 1, and so on).  Your overall exam average is the weighted average of all scores on all exams;
this average counts 82.5% towards the final grade. No scaling or curving is
applied to individual exam scores. </p>

<p> A good way to prepare for these exams is to make sure you can solve all of the homework problems, and to solve problems from <a
href="old_exams.html">old exams</a> from previous incarnations of Math 51; see also below.</p>


<p> Once you pick up your graded midterms, it is your responsibility to look over your assignment (and CourseWork grade), along with the posted solutions, to make sure it is correctly graded. <a href="regrade_policy.html">Here</a> are instructions for how to submit a <a href="regrade_policy.html">regrade request</a> in case there is any issue with your grade.</p>

<h4> Midterm exam 1 </h4>
<p> The first midterm was held <i>in class</i> (the usual room, <b>200-203</b>) 
on <b>Wednesday, July 6</b>. The topics ranged through topics covered in class by the end of <i> Friday, July 1</i>. </p>

<p><a href="midterm1.pdf">Here</a> is the exam. <a href="midterm1_solutions.pdf">Here</a> are solutions to the exam.</p>

<h4> Midterm exam 2 </h4>
<p> The second midterm exam was held <i>in class</i> (the usual room, <b>200-203</b>) on <b>Wednesday, July 27</b>.  The topics ranged through topics covered in class by the end of <i>Friday, July 22</i>.

<p><a href="midterm2.pdf">Here</a> is the exam. <a href="midterm2_solutions.pdf">Here</a> are solutions to the exam. </p>


<h4> Final Exam </h4>

<p> 
The Final Exam was held on <b>Saturday, August 13</b> from <b>7:00pm - 10:00 pm</b>. </p>
<p><a href="final.pdf">Here</a> is the exam (with a small typo fixed in 13g -- because of this typo, everyone received credit for that part of problem 13). <a href="final_solutions.pdf">Here</a> are solutions to the exam. </p>

<h4>Previous Exams (for practice)</h4>
<p> <a href="old_exams.html">Here</a> is a page with links to old exams  given in previous incarnations of Math 51.</p> 

<!--Material covered on a given midterm of a given course may not exactly correlate to the material covered in Math 51 this quarter, so please bear this in mind when working these examples. Also keep in mind that the midterm exams are not of a uniform length, since different courses set different time limits (60 minutes, 90 minutes, 120 minutes, etc.)</p>

<p>When reviewing these exams you should attempt to solve the problems on your own without looking at the included solutions. Working the problems with the solutions at hand will do you no good at all.</p>-->



<h3> Lecture Plan </h3>
<p> Lecture topics by day will be posted on an ongoing basis below. Future
topics are tentative and will be adjusted as necessary. <i>L</i> refers to The
Levandosky, Linear Algebra part of your text (Part 1) and <i>C</i> refers to
the Colley, Vector Calculus part of your text (Part 2).  </p>
