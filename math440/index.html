<h3> Announcements </h3>


<ul>

    <li> <b> 10/2/2017</b>: Our midterm exam will be held this week on <b>Wednesday 10/4</b> in class. In light of this and your HW which is due Monday, all office hours this week are on Monday (VK: 12-1, SG: 1:30-3) or Tuesday (VK: 1-3, SG: 3-4:30).</li>

    <li> <b> 8/21/2017</b>: Welcome to Math 440! Please familiarize yourself with the course syllabus (this website) and exam calendar, and pick up a copy of the course textbook if you have not already. 
    </li>

</ul>
-->

<h3>Overview, texbook, and prerequisites</h3>
<p> 
Topology provides the language of modern analysis and geometry. This course is
an introduction to <i>pointset topology</i>, which formalizes the notion of a
shape (via the notion of a <i>topological space</i>), notions of ``closeness''
(via open and closed sets, convergent sequences), properties of topological
spaces (compactness, completeness, and so on), as well as relations between
spaces (via continuous maps). We will also study many examples, and see some
applications.
</p>

<p> Some topics to be covered include:  </p>

<ul>
    <li>Metric spaces</li>
    <li>Open and closed subsets </li>
    <li>Topological spaces and their properties (connectedness, compactness, etc.)</li>
    <li>Continuous functions</li>
    <li>Constructions of new topological spaces out of old ones (via products and quotients)</li>
    <li>Complete metric spaces</li>
</ul>

<p>As a necessary ingredient, we will recall (and develop) the language of
<i>set theory</i>. Time permitting, we may include other topics, such as the
<i>fundamental group</i> of a topological space.</p> </p>

<p> A more detailed lecture plan (updated on an ongoing basis, after each lecture) will be posted below. </p>


<p> <i>Textbook</i>: The official course text is <i> Topology </i> (2nd edition) by James R. Munkres. 
Within this text, we will focus on Part I, particularly Chapters 1-3 (and other portions on an as-needed basis).
</p>

<p>
<i>Prerequesites</i>: Math 440 is very proof-oriented and requires a certain level of mathematical sophistication. 
It is recommended that you take at least one other upper level mathematics
course before Math 440 (i.e., a MATH course labeled 400 or above), or otherwise
that you have some comfort or familiarity with writing proofs.
</p>

<p>
Math 440 will emphasize a rigorous, proof-intensive development of topics.
There is some overlap with the topics covered in first semester real analysis
(Math 425a), particularly with the notion/study of <i>metric spaces</i>, but
the overall emphasis is rather different.
</p> 


<h3>Grading System</h3>
<ul>
    <li> 35% Homework </li>
    <li> 20% Midterm Exam </li>
    <li> 15% Project </li>
    <li> 30% Final Exam </li>
</ul>



<h3>Homework Assignments</h3>
<p> 
Math 440 will have weekly homework assignments, posted here (a week or more
before they are due). You can handwrite your solutions, but you are encouraged
to consider typing your solutions with <i>LaTeX</i>. You may work with others
and consult references (including the course textbook), but the homework you
turn in <i>must be written by you independently, in your own language, and you
    must cite your sources and collaborators.</i>
</p>


<p><i>Late homeworks will not be accepted.</i> In order to accomodate
exceptional situations such as serious illness, <i>your lowest homework score will
    be dropped</i> at the end of the semester.</p>

<p> <i>Note</i>: we are looking not just for valid proofs, but also a readable,
well explained ones (and indeed, you will be partly graded on readability).
This means you should try to use complete sentences, insert explanations, and
err on the side of writing out "for all" and "there exist", etc. symbols if
there is any chance of confusion.</p>

<p> <i>For further advice on writing your homework (and project paper)</i>, see:

<h3> Exams </h3>
<p>
<ul>
    <li> The <i>midterm exam</i> was held on <b>Wednesday, October 4</b>, <b>in class</b> (e.g., at the usual time 11:00am-11:50am, in the usual place KAP 147). <a href="midterm.pdf">Here</a> is the exam. <a href="midterm_solutions.pdf">Here</a> are solutions.</li>


    <li> The <i>final exam</i> will be held on <b>Wednesday, December 6</b> from <b>11 am to 1 pm</b>, location <b>TBD</b>.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Both exams are <i>closed book</i>, <i>closed notes</i> exams, with no calculators or other electronic aids permitted. The final exam will be cumulative, but will have greater emphasis on topics developed after the midterm.</p>

<h3> Project </h3>

<p>A portion of your class grade will be based upon a project exploring an
aspect of topology beyond the topics covered in class. Concretely, with a small group
of 2-3 students, you will be asked to write a <i>short expository article</i>
(around 4-6 pages, typed), and give an <i>in-class 20 min presentation</i>. The topic
of study will be chosen in consultation with the Instructor.
</p>

<p> The project assignment is posted <a href="project_assignment.pdf">here</a>. Key dates:
<ul>
    <li> <b>Tuesday, 10/31 at 1 pm</b>: decide on group and top 2-3 project choices, and e-mail Instructor.</li>
    <li> <b>Friday, 11/10 at 4 pm</b>: Submit outline to Instructor and Viktor.  </li>
    <li> <b>Monday, 11/20 at 10 am</b>: Submit first draft to Instructor and Viktor.  </li>
    <li> <b>Friday, 12/1 at 4 pm</b>: Submit final draft to Instructor and Viktor.</li>
    <li> Class presentations: <b>November 20, November 27, November 29, and December 1 in class</b></li>
</ul>
</p>






<h4> Students with Disabilities</h4>
<p>
Any student requesting academic accommodations based on a disability is
required to register with <a href="https://dsp.usc.edu">Disability Services and Programs (DSP)</a> each semester.
A letter of verification for approved accommodations can be obtained from DSP.
<i>If required, please make sure that the DSP letter (for approved accomodations) is delivered to me as early in the semester as
    possible</i>.  For more details, see the DSP web site 
<a href="https://dsp.usc.edu/">here</a>; in particular contact information is <a href="http://dsp.usc.edu/contact/">here</a>.
</p>

<h4> Academic Integrity </h4>

<p>
The instructor strongly adheres to the University policies regarding principles
of academic honesty and academic integrity violations, and will strictly
enforce these rules. You are encouraged to review those, for instance in
SCampus, the Student Guidebook (see e.g., University Governance, Section 11.00
and Appendix A).  
</p>

<h3> Disclaimer </h3>
<p>This syllabus is not a contract, and the Instructor reserves the right to make some changes during the semester.</p>

            If Y is a subset of X, then the two notions of compactness we've
            discussed (for Y as a subset of X, and for Y thought of as
            asubspace) agree. Closed intervals [a,b] of R are compact (in
            either sense). A list of some methods for constructing compact
            subsets: 1) closed intervals in R are compact, 2) finite products
            are compact, 3) images of compact subsets under continuous maps are
            compact, 4) closed subsets of compact spaces are compact, and 5)
            the Heine-Borel theorem: a subset of R^n is compact iff it's closed
            and bounded (with respect to the standard metric).

            Completed proof that products of compact spaces are compact.
            Compact subsets of Hausdorff spaces are closed, and compact subsets
            of metric spaces are always bounded. In R^n, a subset is compact
            iff it is closed and bounded (the Heine-Borel theorem).

Furthermore, if f was a continuous map between spaces, then bar(f) becomes continuous with respect to the quotient topology on
